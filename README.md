# wanneerbenikklaar
A repo that holds the code to my funny but practical personal projects, helping students calculate when they'll finish their internships.

Stemming from a personal frustration of having to do this by hand. I'm bad with dates. I don't want to be doing this on my own, and ChatGPT is too stupid to do what I'm asking it. Good thing I'm a developer, so I'll just do it myself.
